# Assembly Code
* There are 16 General purpose registers
  - %rax - The first return register
  - %rbp - The base pointer that keeps track if the base of the stack
  - %rsp - The stack pointer that points to the top of the stack
### Common Terms
* HEAP - Memory that can be allocated and deallocated
* STACK - A contiguous section of memory used for passing arguments
* GENERAL REGISTER - A multipurpose register that can be used by either programmer or user to store data or a memory location address
* CONTROL REGISTER - A processor register that changes or controls the behavior of a CPU
* FLAGS REGISTER - Contains the current state of the processor
### Memory Offset
* Instruction Pointer - holds address for next instruction to be executed
  - RIP (64-Bit)
  - EIP (Lower 32 Bits)
  - IP (Lower 16 Bits)
### Common Instruction Pointers
* MOV  - move source to destination
* PUSH - push source onto stack
* POP  - Pop top of stack to destination
* INC  - Increment source by 1
* DEC  - Decrement source by 1
* ADD  - Add source to destination
* SUB  - Subtract source from destination
* CMP  - Compare 2 values by subtracting them and setting the %RFLAGS register. ZeroFlag set means they are the same.
* JMP  - Jump to specified location
* JLE  - Jump if less than or equal
* JE   - Jump if equal
### Reverse Engineering Workflow
* Static - use file, strings, cat the file
* Behavioral - Seeing how the program works while its running
* Dissassembly - Debugger
* Document findings - You document findings
# Assembly Code Demo
#### Example 1
```
main:
   mov rax, 16     # Moving into rax the value of 16
   push rax        # Pushing the valie in rax (16) onto the stack. RSP is pushed up by 8 bytes
   jmp mem2        # Jump to mem2 function
   
mem1:
   mov rax, 0      # Moving into rax the value of 0
   ret             # Return
   
mem2:
  pop r8           # Popping value (16) off of stack and storing in r8. RSP falls by 8 bytes
  cmp rax, r8      # Comparing to rax value (16) the value of r8 (16)
  je mem1          # Previous comparison ends with zero flag set; jump to mem1; "je" - jump if equal

```
#### Example 2
```
main:
  mov rcx, 25      # Moving into rcx the value of 25
  mov rbx, 62      # Moving into rbx the value of 62
  jmp mem1         # Jump to mem1

mem1:
  sub rbx, 40      # Subtract from the value in rbx  (62) 40. Reslult is rbx=22
  mov rs1, rbx     # Moving into rsi the value of (22)
  cmp rcx, rsi     # Compare to rcx (25) the value of rsi (22). 
  jmple mem2       # Zero flag is not set. RSI < RCX. Jump to mem2; "jmple" - jump if less than or equal to

mem2:
  mov rax, 0       # Moving into rax the value of 0
  ret              # Return
```
